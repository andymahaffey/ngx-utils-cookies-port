# ngx-utils-cookies-port

This library is a fork of [`ngx-utils-cookies-port`](https://github.com/junekpavel/ngx-utils-cookies-port), which is a 
port of [`@ngx-utils/cookies`](https://github.com/ngx-utils/cookies).
Created because `ngx-utils-cookies-port` hasn't been updated since Angular 9.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @seeplusplus/ngx-utils-cookies-port --save
```

## Usage
Follow [original documentation](https://github.com/ngx-utils/cookies#readme).

```typescript

import {CookiesService} from 'ngx-utils-cookies-port';

```
